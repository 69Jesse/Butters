# Butters
The source code of my Discord bot Butters

For now it's most of the code that just makes the bot functional with some games that are (pretty much) finished. I will be adding more here on GitHub in the very near future.
I do not really see a reason why anyone would use this code for their own, but feel free to do so if you really want to. Some credits would be nice if you're using any of it, but it is of course not a requirement.
